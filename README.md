# Weather App
This application is a simple integration of AngularJS and OpenWeatherMap. 

To install:
- Download the application and run 'npm install' in your command line
- Once installed, run 'node server.js', which is a simple server setup
- Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080/#!/ to view your weather!

The set up is pretty straight-forward:
- The initial app defines 2 routes with 1 controller
- 1 view and 1 directive renders our initial and search results screens
- The service returns API data to the result controller
- And of course, some html and css to round things out
